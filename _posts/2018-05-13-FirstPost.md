Now that the jekyl fork has been renamed and the config file adjusted properly, the blog seems to be a reality.

Plans for the blog.  
1. Move the Experts-Exchange articles over to github.  
2. Add topic areas (?tags?, ?sub folders?)  
3. Add new articles, based on the lightning talks I've given  
4. Add new articles, based on my user-group and conference presentations
